# :woman: **About Me!**

> [!WARNING]
> Have tried to use as many markdown features as possible so that I can refer to this page at a later date, please note this may elicit a sense that your timeline has reverted to the 1990s when myspace was a thing and people tried to make their page look as fancy as possible by using every known feature!

### Name
Alexandra aka ~~Branticus94 (please don't laugh at my username I made it circa 2019 when I was first dabbling with code, unmarried (hence Brant), using a nickname I was adorned with during my school years when I was rather fond of greek/roman history and mythology, think: this is sparta)~~ 'Alex' Howland
