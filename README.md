# How I will be using Github for this assignment
I will be using Github for this assignment as a remote repository to store code. 

In order to fulfil the requirements I needed to create a repo on github named CFG-Assignments. I created the repo with the built in GUI in Github:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aaf5df65-14cc-41cb-be50-6952a23f729e)

I then used the computer terminal to create my file for upload to the remote repo. I first navigated  to the folder I wish to create my folder in using  the "cd" command (change directory), my preferred folder being documents. I checked I was in the correct directory with "ls" (list) command: 

```
AlexHowland@Toms-MacBook-Pro-2 ~ % ls
Applications	Documents	Library		Music		Public
Desktop		Downloads	Movies		Pictures	PycharmProjects
AlexHowland@Toms-MacBook-Pro-2 ~ % cd Documents
AlexHowland@Toms-MacBook-Pro-2 Documents % ls
CFG Degree		CFG Python		CV and Job Applications
```

Once  I was in the correct location I made a directory using the "mkdir" command, naming the directory CFG-Assignments, again checking the output of my code as I went:

```
AlexHowland@Toms-MacBook-Pro-2 Documents % mkdir CFG-Assignments
AlexHowland@Toms-MacBook-Pro-2 Documents % ls
CFG Degree		CFG-Assignments
CFG Python		CV and Job Applications
```

Once the folder was created I used the "cd" command to change directory to within the folder, followed by the "git init" command to initialise git within the directory:
```
AlexHowland@Toms-MacBook-Pro-2 Documents % cd CFG-Assignments
AlexHowland@Toms-MacBook-Pro-2 CFG-Assignments % git init
hint: Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch. This default branch name
hint: is subject to change. To configure the initial branch name to use in all
hint: of your new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call:
hint: 
hint: 	git config --global init.defaultBranch <name>
hint: 
hint: Names commonly chosen instead of 'master' are 'main', 'trunk' and
hint: 'development'. The just-created branch can be renamed via this command:
hint: 
hint: 	git branch -m <name>
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/AlexHowland/Documents/CFG-Assignments/.git/
```

I created a readme file using the "touch" command, confirming the output with the "ls" command:
```
AlexHowland@Toms-MacBook-Pro-2 CFG-Assignments % touch README.md
AlexHowland@Toms-MacBook-Pro-2 CFG-Assignments % ls
README.md
```

I then checked the git status, as you can see I am on the master/main branch, there have been no commits and I have one untracked file, the README.md file.  
```
AlexHowland@Toms-MacBook-Pro-2 CFG-Assignments % git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	README.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

I used the ''git add'' command to move my file from the local working directory into the local staging area to prepare for  the commit, using the "git status" command you can see I now have one file to be committed:
```
AlexHowland@Toms-MacBook-Pro-2 CFG-Assignments % git add README.md
AlexHowland@Toms-MacBook-Pro-2 CFG-Assignments % git status  
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   README.md
```

I then used "git commit" to move the file from the local staging area to the local repo with the message _'initial commit'_, I can see that there is one file changed with no insertions/deletions:
```
AlexHowland@Toms-MacBook-Pro-2 CFG-Assignments % git commit -m 'initial commit'
[master (root-commit) 4b1de82] initial commit
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 README.md
```

Finally to move the file from the local repo to the remote repo I performed the following. I used the git remote add origin command to specify the location of the remote repo where I wish to push/pull my files to/from. The git branch -M main command is used to rename the current branch from master to main to avoid naming conflicts. Finally I used the git push command to send my files to the remote repo on Github: 
```
AlexHowland@Toms-MacBook-Pro-2 CFG-Assignments % git remote add origin git@github.com:branticus94/CFG-Assignments.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
Enumerating objects: 3, done.
Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 222 bytes | 222.00 KiB/s, done.

To github.com:branticus94/CFG-Assignments.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
branch 'main' set up to track 'origin/main'.
```

To test out the "git pull" command I edited the markdown file in the github using the GUI:

<img width="800" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ad8105c-ed3f-4868-a9ef-4cc84557812d">

Once I had completed some of my write up, making a few commits along the way and testing the output/fixing any bugs (note to self: backticks for quoting code rather than single quotes!) to allow me to track my work! I then reverted to the terminal to test the connection and whether I could obtain the changes on my terminal, as you can see from the below I used the git pull command which produced a fast forward merge as there were no conflicts withere were several insertions and deletions to the README file I initially created: 

```
AlexHowland@Toms-MacBook-Pro-2 CFG-Assignments % git pull

```

I then used vim to review the file and continue documenting and working on my local machine (as you can see from my screenshot!:
![screenshot of using vim to edit README.md file](pullrequestvim.png)

I then repeated the process (getting a little quicker this time!) to send my local changes back to Github! So happy that I've managed to make it communicate both ways üòÑ

# Creating a .gitignore, explaining what it is for!
Gitignore files are important files which allow the user to hide certain files or parts of the project which you would not want to share, protecting the git repository. It acts as a list of instructions of files or file directories or types of files that git needs to ignore. a gitignore file is typically created in the repository's root directory. 

Examples of such files would be files containing sensitive information (e.g. personal passwords, API keys, security certificates), files which are large as these bloat the system, files which hold local logs or environment variables

With a file(s) of your choice, demonstrate the following:
‚óã Checking the status
‚óã Creating a branch
‚óã Adding files to a branch
‚óã Adding commits with meaningful messages
‚óã Opening a pull request
‚óã Merging and deploying to main branch
If needed, take screenshots of the process and add to your README file.
+ Create .gitignore (can be empty) and briefly explain what it is for
+ Create requirements.txt (can be empty) and briefly explain what it is for
